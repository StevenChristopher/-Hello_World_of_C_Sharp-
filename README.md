This repository is a novice level collection of various C# programs. These programs are slightly modified from the original source at times. However, original source is cited along with author where applicable on each program. This is a student project and should be considered a living document, as well.

All programs were verified to compile using MS Visual Studio 2017. After programs were verified to compile, display and close correctly, code was copied into NotePad++ as a .cs program. This was done in an attempt to ensure that the code could be copied and pasted into any compiler with the same resulting outputs.

Cheers!
